// Learning to work with arrays and I did learn that we are not limited to 1 data type per array 
// Sample arrays below 

let severedArray = ['table fruits that are boring',['apple', 'orange']];
severedArray;

let thirdArray = ['table fruits that are boring', ['appple','orange'], 'table fruits that are exciting', ['cucamelon', 'starfruit']];
thirdArray;

// Replace data at index 1 (apple, orange)
// severedArray[1] = ['banana', 'melon'];
// severedArray; 
        // (2) ["table fruits that are boring", Array(2)]
        // 0: "table fruits that are boring"
        // 1: (2) ["banana", "melon"]

// Did this work in console log to get used to working with arrays but in a production environment I wouldnt manipulate the data in the console, I don't think but I need to go eat
